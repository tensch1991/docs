{: #gettingstartedtemplate}
*Last updated: 11 February 2016*

With {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_full}} on Bluemix ({{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}}), you can perform analytics on real-time data from your Internet of Things devices, and gain insights about their health and the overall state of your operations.
{:shortdesc}

Before you can start using {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} you must set up the {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} service ({{site.data.keyword.iot_short}}) to connect your analytics engine to your devices.  You can use an existing {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} service or create a new one. To quickly get up and running you can deploy the Internet of Things phone application and its associated {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} service to your organization.

To get up and running quickly with this service, follow these steps:
1. Deploy the {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} service to your Bluemix organization.
  1. From your Bluemix account Dashboard, click **Use services or APIs**.
  2. Locate the Internet of Things section of the service catalog and select **{{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}}**.
  3. On the {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} page, verify the Add Service selections:  
    - Space - Verify that you are deploying the service in the same space that you deployed the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} service.
    - App - Leave unbound.
    - Service name - Optionally change the service name to something that is easy to remember. This name is displayed in the IoT {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} tile in the Bluemix dashboard.
    - Selected plan - Select Free or a purchase plan that is suitable for your needs.  
    > **Important:** With the free {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} plan, you can deploy only one instance of the service per organization.
  4. Click **Use** to deploy {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} to your Bluemix services.
2. Optional: Use your phone as an IoT device with IoT {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}}.  
Use the Internet of Things phone application to quickly set up your smart phone to act as an IoT device that you can use to verify your {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} environment and begin to define real-time analytics on the data.For more information about the Internet of Things Phone application, see the [Internet of Things phone application](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/IoT-html5-phone) project.

  To create the application and connect your phone to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}}:
  1. Click the button below to start the deployment process:   
  [![Deploy to Bluemix icon.](images/deploy_to_bluemix.png "Deploy to Bluemix icon")](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/ibm-messaging/iot-html5-phone "Deploy the IoT Phone to Bluemix")  
  > **Note:** Deploying the Internet of Things phone application also deploys an {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} service (*iot-phone-iotf-service*) that automatically binds to the phone application. Add this {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} as a data source to test the Internet of Things phone application. It also creates a Cloudant NoSQL DB service (*iot-phone-cloudant-cloudantNoSQLDB*) that is used by the application.

  2. Click **Approve** if you are prompted to self approve access for IBM Single Sign On Service (OAuth Consent).  
  >**Tip:** If you don't have a Bluemix account you can sign up to activate your free Bluemix trial.
  2. Change the APP NAME field to something easy to remember; we'll call this *phone application* throughout the rest of these instructions. This name will be displayed in an application tile in your Bluemix dashboard and is part of the URL that you will use when connecting your phone to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}}.
  2. Click **Deploy**.
  2. After the deployment process is complete and you see a 'Success' message, return to your Bluemix dashboard.  
  The *phone application* tile and the *iot-phone-iotf-service* tile are added to your account.
  1. From the Bluemix dashboard, click the *phone application* tile.
  2. From your phone, open a browser and go to the Routes URL that is displayed beneath the application name. When prompted, enter a device ID of your choosing to identify your phone as a device in the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} and IoT {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} dashboards.
  3. Click **Connect** to connect your phone to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} *iot-phone-iotf-service*.  
  The view refreshes to display the data that is sent from your phone to your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}}.
2. Create and configure an Internet of Things service.  
> **Tip:** If you deployed the Internet of Things phone application, the  *iot-phone-iotf-service* is already created and you can skip this step.  

  1. Log in to the Bluemix organization and select the space where you want to deploy IoT {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}}.
  2. From the Bluemix Dashboard, click **Use services or APIs**.
  3. Locate the Internet of Things section of the service catalog and select **Internet of Things**.
  4. On the {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} page, verify the Add Service selections and click **Use** to add {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} to your Bluemix services.  
  After the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} service is deployed, you are brought to the service management page.
3. Locate the connection API keys.  
If you created a new {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} service, you must now create API keys to connect the two services. If you are using an existing service, you can use the existing keys.  
  1. From the Bluemix dashboard, click the Internet of Things tile.  
  >**Note:**  If you are using the Internet of Things phone application, click the the *iot-phone-iotf-service* tile.  

  1. Click **Launch dashboard** to open the {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} dashboard.
  2. Navigate to **Access > API Keys**.
  3. Click **Generate API Key**.
  3. Make a note of the API Key, Authentication Token, and the Organization ID that is displayed at the top of the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} dashboard.  
  You use this information in IoT {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} to connect the services.
4. Connect your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} service and IoT {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} service.
  1. From the Bluemix dashboard, click the IoT {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} tile.  
  2. In the service page, click **Add a data source**.
  2. In the {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} console Manage Data Sources page, click **Add New Data Source**.
  3. Give the data source a descriptive name and provide the following information that you collected earlier:
    - Organization ID
    - API Key
    - Authentication Token
  4. Click ![Create icon.](images/create.png "Create icon") to create the data source and connect to it.
4. Start using {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}}.  
You can now start using {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} by adding users, connecting your devices, configuring dashboards to view relevant device data, and setting up alerts.
>**Selecting your {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} instance:** If you have been granted access to any additional {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} instances as an operator or administrator you can quickly switch between these instances. In the {{site.data.keyword.iotrtinsights_short}} console, click your user name and select the instance that you want to access.
